      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hello! My name is Tim Saff and I've just started
        to learn programming.</p>
      <p>Let's not focus on who I am at the moment and
        look at this beautiful page instead! Sure, it doesn't have a lot
        going on right now but over time that should change. Althought
      I'm not exactly sure how much time it will actually take
        to turn this into a proper CV, I'm sure it will be an
        interesting and challenging process nonetheless.

      <h2>What this is all about</h2>
      <p>I've decided to take on programming for multiple reasons: out of sheer curiosity, to learn new skills,
        to discipline and better myself as a person. As it stands right now, I am not content with the state of my life
        and I'm willing to change that.

      <h2>My Skills</h2>
      <p>There isn't much to brag about when it comes to my programming skills.
        I've learned the basics of HTML, currently trying to figure out CSS.
        I've also studied a little bit of Python prior to that but that's about it.</p>

      <h2>My hobbies and interests</h2>
      <p>Honestly, I've tried a bit of everything over the years, had a limited success
        with my amateur video editing skills making music videos, song extensions and gameplay compilations.
        Was messing around with Photoshop for a certain period of time though not on a professional level either.
        My biggest hobby is, of course, speaking English, with people from all over the world, on the daily. Yes.
